# Accessibility Driven Development
Accessibility Driven Development principles. Pave the way!

We're living in a world of discrimination, racial prejudice and injustice. We can't afford these things to happen in front of us or the areas we can have influence on. We truly believe apart of "Clean Code", "Good Architectural Design" and a lot of other beautiful terms there's one thing a lot of people are really missing or skipping in their daily job. For us a11y equals semantics and meaningful code. 
Inclusive Design for the masses.

### Main Principles
- Start thinking about a11y support from the day 0
- A really small change matters a lot
- If you don't want to be descriminated - do not descriminate others
- Each new feature should enable but not disable - always keep it in mind
- to be continued
